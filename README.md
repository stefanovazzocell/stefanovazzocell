# Hello, I'm Stefano

Hi, I'm Stefano - a Software Engineer currently working with the Cloud Security team at [Cisco](https://cisco.com/).

On my free time I like ⛷️ skiing, 🥾 hiking, 🧳 traveling, and 👨‍💻 working on open source personal projects.

Talk with me about privacy, security, networking, and Go.
